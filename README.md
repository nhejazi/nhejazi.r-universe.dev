# My own R Universe

This repository provides a configuration for how some of my R packages available
on GitHub are distributed via the R universe package repository at
<https://nhejazi.r-universe.dev/>. See also the R universe GitHub repository at
<https://github.com/r-universe/nhejazi/>, which includes automated builds of R
packages via GitHub Actions.
